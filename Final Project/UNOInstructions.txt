UNO INSTRUCTIONS:

Naturally, the object of Uno is to get rid of all your cards before anyone else does.
You have lots of fun cards you can use to make others pick up cards, but of course they can use them against you as well.
That's the fun ... and the excitement ... of Uno. So roust the gang for America's #1 card game! It's easy to learn. Here we go.

Each player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number, color or word. 
For example, if the top card on the discard pile is a red 7, a player must throw down a red card or any color 7. 
Or the player can throw down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have anything to match, he must pick a card from the draw pile. 
If he can play what is drawn, great. Otherwise play moves to the next person. 
You do not have to continue picking up until you come across a card you can play.

So what's a Wild? This type of card lets you change the color of play. 
For example, if there is a blue 3 on top of the pile, and you have more yellow cards you want to play, you could lay down a wild card.
Announce that you're changing the color to yellow, and the next player must play cards of that color. 
Or change the color again with another wild--a nasty but legal trick.

You'll also come across cards labeled Skip. 
Quite simply, this card will skip the person next to you, and let the following player have her turn right away.

Found a Reverse card? If you play that card, then the order of play is reversed. 
Instead of the player on your left playing after you, it will pass to the one on your right. 
In other words, if play is proceeding clockwise, this card will change it to counter-clockwise.

Cards labeled Draw 2 or Plus 2 are pickup cards. 
The player next to you will have to pick up two cards if you play one of these.

Lastly, you will come across cards called Wild Draw 4. 
This means that, if played, the player gets to change the color ... and the player next to him has to pick up four cards.

 IMPORTANT => When you have one card left, you must click the "Call UNO" butten when the pop-up window is displayed on the screen.
 You will have three seconds to click the "Call UNO" button before the window disapears. If you do not manage to click the button before 
 it disapears... you will recieve two cards.

Scoring

If you win the game, you give yourself points according to the number and type of cards left in opponents' hands. 
Here's a list for you:

Number cards: Face value 
Non-wild word cards: 20 points 
Wild cards: 50 points

The first player to reach 500 points wins the game! 
But don't expect it to be too easy--the UNO card deck is packed with Command Cards that may foil your plans!
