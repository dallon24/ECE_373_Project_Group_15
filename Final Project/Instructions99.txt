Objective: Keep the point total at or less than 99.

Game Start:
1. Players receive 5 cards from the dealer.
2. As the play goes, current player plays a card.
3. The point total starts at zero and each card adds its face value in points (e.g., a 5 is worth five points), 
except for certain cards that have special values or meanings.

Note: The point total cannot get below zero. 
If player plays a special card then make a subtraction decision, the lowest point total can get after the played is zero.

Special Cards:
King - unconditionally takes the point total to 99
Queen - either adds 20 or subtract 20 from the total
Jack - Pass
10 - either adds 10 or subtract 10 from the total
Ace (Heart, Club, Diamond) - either adds 1 or subtract 1 from the total 
Spade Ace - take point total back to Zero

4. Player will get a replacement card after each card is played.
5. If player plays a card then the point total exceeds 99, that player loses the game and game keeps playing with the remaining players.
6. Game keeps going until only on player left. That Player becomes winner!
